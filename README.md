# gw-121-gdb

Project files for the COS121 Gateway exam for testing compiling/gdb skills

## Instructions

After cloning this git repo, students must travel to the respective directories to test their skills with g++, Makefiles, and gdb

## Gateway Skills Tests:

1. g++:  Compile a single file with all code warning capability turned on.
2. g++:  Compile a single file so that the object code version of the file (.o) is created.
3. g++:  Compile multiple cpp files that are all needed for the program.
4. g++:  Compile multiple object code files (.o) together to create an executable.
5. make:  Use a provided Makefile and the make program to compile a program.
6. make:  Show what happens when you tell make to recompile everything, but nothing needs to be recompiled.
7. make:  Cause a file's modification time to be changed (without actually changing) so that make will recompile the file.
8. make:  Explain how a makefile works.
9. make:  Use a provided Makefile and make program to get rid of unnecessary files.
10. gdb:  Open gdb for your output file.
11. gdb:  Run the program (within gdb).
12. gdb:  Set a breakpoint at some line and run until hit breakpoint.
13. gdb:  Print value of a variable in current scope.
14. gdb:  Tell gdb to run just the next line of code.
15. gdb:  Quit gdb.
16. shell:  Execute your program (normal method).
17. tar:  TAR relevant files (as if you were to submit them)
